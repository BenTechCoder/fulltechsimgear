The first step is that you need to buy a sheet of coroplast blank sign plastic here is the link if you happen to have trouble finding it.

Another place you can go to for this sheet of plastic is your local Loews or Home depot, or any other local hardware store.

Next you will need to buy a Usb joystick encoder and 6 micro lever, the joystick encoder. switches here are the amazon links.<https://www.amazon.com/Quimat-Arcade-Encoder-Joystick-Fighting/dp/B06XD1WF8G/ref=sr_1_6?crid=MGX3WW7XLQA0&dchild=1&keywords=joystick+encoder&qid=1634333851&sr=8-6.> The  micro lever switches. <https://www.amazon.com/URBESTAC-Momentary-Hinge-Roller-Switches/dp/B00MFRMFS6/ref=sr_1_6?crid=22IEIRF82AYF4&dchild=1&keywords=micro+lever+switch&qid=1634333970&sr=8-6.>



Next you will need the metal pipe, oh and I will also put the Thingiverse link for the shifter knob in case you would like this one. <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:422254>

Now you will need to cut the plastic to size, here are the dimensions.

Here is the next set of dimensions.

Now here are the dimensions for the shifter pattern. Oh and I suggest that to cut out the pattern to use a router, or a jig saw, or any other tool will work. I personally used a router and I worked just fine so thats what I highly suggest.
