Hello Every one!!! My name is Nathan and I am 13. But at the beginning of this pandemic I started to get in to simulators the first one I ever started playing was Farming Simulator 19.

And I absolutely loved it, it was such a great game. But then I started modding all kinds of car mods, and then it went from playing Farming simulator to racing in Farming simulator. and I had that Logitech heavy equipment bundle which I still use till this day
