Hello. Here are some other web sites and you could also use and that I personally liked, and sort of used some design ideas for my own products. Also please keep in mind that my whole desire of this website and these guides, is to prove that sim racing does not have to be all that expensive, so enjoy!!!

So here is the first one that I personally used for my pedals and I might be putting a more detailed guide for these pedals because I did not document the whole prosses. [E-Sim Racing Pedals : 3 Steps - Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/E-Sim-Racing-Pedals/)
